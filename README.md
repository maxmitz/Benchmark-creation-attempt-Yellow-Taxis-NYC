The files are part of the master thesis "Deterministic constructionheuristics for the time-dependenttravelling salesman problem" for which an attempt was made
to create a time-dependent benchmark with the Yellow Taxi data which was provided by New York City (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). 
The attempt was later discarded due to the data distribution which made it impossible to generate a benchmark with sufficient quality.
Further information can be found in Section 6 of the attached thesis.
